## Swiss Ephemeris PHP Classes

With these PHP classes you can query the ***Swiss Ephemeris Software*** which is based on ***VB***. 
With the PHP class, the position of astrological objects is queried via the ***exec()*** function through the terminal. 
My idea for the query was to use a kind of repository class to comfortably configure the query to the ***table file (.eph)***. 
If you have any suggestions for improvement, write to me on ***GITHUB***.

###To begin, read this README.md file carefully

---

####Important:
>This software only works with the ***.eph*** files.
>These must be in the ***/sweph*** folder or the path to the file must be specified in the constructor.
>I have included a small ***.eph*** table with a small time range


The best way to use this classes
---
Install via Composer Dependency Manager to your project a PHP project on an Linux system 
on (*Windows are having problems because the commands are sent to the cmd.exe.*).
Add to your composer.json file and run `composer update`  after that ***move the .se1 
files from /demo to /sweph*** folder.
```
